# rewrite `model_id` to blame a different caller without breaking the chain,

# fields from such a row, or adding them to one that had none, changes the

    the known-answer vectors in the tests pin all three together.

    Two properties matter, and both have already been got wrong once:

    - **Byte lengths, not character counts.** Python's ``len()`` counts code
      points while Rust's ``str::len()`` counts UTF-8 bytes. They agree for
      ASCII, which is how the divergence hides, and disagree for anything else
      -- so a retry issued by the other implementation would carry a different
      token, ClickHouse would see a new block, and the duplicate would land.
    - **Length-prefixed, not merely separated.** Identifiers are free-form, so
      joining on ``:`` alone is not injective: ``("a:b", "c", 1)`` and
      ``("a", "b:c", 1)`` both give ``a:b:c:1``, and two segments sharing a
      token means one is dropped while its writer is told it succeeded.
