"""Run every SQL builder against a REAL ClickHouse holding known rows.

Why this file exists
--------------------

The unit suites stub ClickHouse with fakes whose ``run()`` matches on a
substring of the SQL and returns canned rows. That validates "the code called
ClickHouse", never "the SQL is correct". Every ClickHouse bug this project has
shipped got through a green unit suite:

- ``toString(col) AS col`` shadowing the real column, so a datetime filter
  became a lexical string compare (M6a, and again in 2026-08-26's same-day
  window bug, where a short window silently returned 0 rows instead of 631).
- ``events.timestamp`` being ``DateTime64(3,'UTC')`` and rejecting a raw ISO
  ``+00:00`` string, a live ``TYPE_MISMATCH`` (M12 ``observed_by``).
- ``load_subgraph`` deriving nodes FROM edges, so an isolated firewall node with
  zero edges was invisible -- masked by a stub that returned it anyway (M12).

None of those are detectable without a real server: they are the server's
semantics, not the code's. So this module executes each builder's real SQL
against a real ClickHouse and asserts what comes back.

Marked ``contract`` rather than ``integration``: it needs ONLY a throwaway
ClickHouse -- no lab, no MCP endpoints, no credentials, and it writes nothing
anyone else reads. CI runs it against a service container on every pull request;
``integration`` stays lab-only. Fixtures are written under their own tenant so a
run cannot disturb other data if pointed somewhere shared.
